              Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
              looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to their
              own section. Continue reading for an introduction to the
              documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

              React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
              iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native
              capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
              platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
              of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable
              code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But
              first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.

            <p>react fundamentals</p>
            <ul>
              We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:
              <li>
                + components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats
                in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need
                names and a cafe to work in.
              </li>
              <li>
                + JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
                write elements inside JavaScript like so: &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I
                am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;.
                <p>
                  The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer
                  to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
                  variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the
                  cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
                  &lt;Text&gt;
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>+ props. Props is short for “properties”.</li>
              <li>
                + state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to
                configure how components render, state is like a component’s
                personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
                changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State
                gives your components memory!

              TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
              It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called
              every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
              takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
              their words into a different language. In this new language, every
              single word is written the same way: 🍕. So the sentence "Hello
              there Bob" would be translated as "🍕 🍕".
